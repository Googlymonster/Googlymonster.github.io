## Hi! I'm Kevin Nguyen.

...I am a mobile app designer and developer. I have designed and developed apps for both iOS and Android.

<br/>
### My Story

I graduated from Texas Tech University in 2013 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Upon graduating I worked as a field engineer before transitioning to a data analyst role. During my transition into a data analyst I became intrigued with software development. I started with learning web development, but eventually found mobile app development to be my passion.

### My Design Process

My design process starts with defining what issue is being solved by the app I'm making. Additional things like market research is carried out in the form of competitor analysis and marketing strategies. And lastly identifing the target audience will helps define the features needed for the app. This gives me an idea as to how design the User experience and build the User interface.

<br/>
Tools like [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html?promoid=PYPVQ3HN&mv=other) allow me to wireframe and prototype how I want the app to look and feel. Once the UI is complete it can then move on to development.
