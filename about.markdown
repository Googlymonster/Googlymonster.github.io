## Hi! I'm Kevin Nguyen.

...I am an software designer and developer hobbyist. I have designed and developed apps for Web, iOS, and Android.

<br/>
### My Story

I graduated from Texas Tech University in 2013 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Upon graduating I worked as a field engineer before transitioning to a data analyst role. In my current role as a data engineer I perform ETL task using a variety of tools like Python, SQL, and VBA. 

<br/>
During my transition into a data engineer I became intrigued with software development. I started with learning web development and eventually found my way to mobile development.

<br/>
### My Design Process

My design process starts with defining what issue is being solved by the app I'm making. Additional things like market research is carried out in the form of competitor analysis and marketing strategies. And lastly identifing the target audience will helps define the features needed for the app. This gives me an idea as to how design the User experience and build the User interface.

<br/>
Utilizing tools like [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html?promoid=PYPVQ3HN&mv=other) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) allows me to wireframe and prototype how I want the applications to look and feel. Once the UI mock-up is complete it can then move on to development.
